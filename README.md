# 🔋 Battery SOH & RUL Prediction using ML Models

🔬 This project focuses on accurate battery degradation forecasting using deep learning, enabling proactive maintenance and management of lithium-ion batteries.

This repository presents machine learning-based approaches to predict the **State of Health (SOH)** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of lithium-ion batteries using real-world datasets from NASA.  
Trained on battery charge cycle data, the models are visualized and evaluated through an interactive web interface.

## 🧠 Core Machine Learning Models

This project emphasizes three key deep learning architectures for time series regression:

### 🔸 1. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- A fully connected feedforward neural network.
- Trained on 5-length historical SOH (%) sequences.
- Suitable for basic pattern recognition and fast training.
- Acts as a **baseline model** for comparison with sequence-aware networks.

### 🔸 2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Recurrent neural network architecture ideal for sequential data.
- Learns long-term dependencies in battery degradation patterns.
- Outperforms MLP in capturing time-dependent trends in SOH prediction.
- Trained using sliding window sequences of battery cycles.

### 🔸 3. Transformer
- State-of-the-art architecture used in natural language processing and time series tasks.
- Uses **self-attention** to capture global dependencies across all sequence points.
- Provides better generalization on longer sequences compared to RNNs.
- Particularly effective in modeling capacity degradation without recurrence.

### 📈 Common Features Across Models

- **Input**: Sequences of 5 previous SOH values  
- **Output**: Next SOH prediction and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation  
- **Metrics**: MAE, RMSE score for evaluation

## 📁 Dataset

We use the publicly available `.mat` datasets from NASA’s Prognostics Data Repository:

- `B0005.mat`, `B0006.mat`, `B0007.mat`, `B0008.mat`

**Preprocessing:**
- Extracted charge cycles and integrated current to calculate **capacity (Ah)**.
- Derived **SOH (%)** using voltage, current, and temperature measurements.
- SOH is computed using the formula:

```
SOH = (Ct / Cinitial) × 100
```
